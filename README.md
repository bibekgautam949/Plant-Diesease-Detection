# Plant-Diesease-Detection
This is our Final Year Project for college.
Here, we have created CNN Model that predicts the diesease in the plant.
We have setup Raspberry-Pi for the real time operation of task to be done.
Pi Camera is connected to Raspberry- Pi and it takes image from user and send to pretrained model resulting generation of output.
The API, integration of hardware are in final stage and will be soon uploaded.
This project is completed based on Python Programming Language.
